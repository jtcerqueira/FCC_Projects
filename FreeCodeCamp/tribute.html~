     <h3> The impact of David L. Clarke's death on the university. </h3>
       <p> <span dir="ltr"> <em>"His fears were realized as the exam started, based on the kinds of questions he was getting and the kinds of responses he received for his lame answers. But the exam had not quite yet turned into the bloodbath it would presumably become when the Department Secretary came into the conference room, interrupting the examination, to make an important announcement. 

“David Clarke is Dead.”

David Clarke was revered in this department, and the news was so devastating that the examiners … senior faculty all … forgot what they were doing and wandered off in a daze. Later, no one could recollect how the exam had gone (except F.G. of course, who was left rather hanging by this event).

Since no one could really remember what had happened, they really couldn’t fail him. So they let him stay. F.G. eventually became a credit to the department. In his own way."
